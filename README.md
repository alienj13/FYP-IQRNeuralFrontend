# FYP-IQRNeuralFrontend
Project overview:
The field of neuroscience research relies increasingly on computational modelling. This project emerges from a recognised need to address a critical issue in neuroscience research. Presently, there's a significant challenge in effectively comprehending and communicating the complexity of neuronal data.

The existing methods, primarily static 2D formats, limit our ability to fully understand these intricate neuronal networks. Therefore, the project aims to create a web-based interface that translates neuronal simulations into immersive 3D visualisations via the Unity game engine.

The primary goal is to enhance accessibility, visualisation and comprehension of this critical research data. 



Project deliverable:
The primary project deliverable is a fully functional web-based platform. This platform will empower researchers to effortlessly upload IQR-generated XML files, which will be transformed into interactive 3D representations. Leveraging the Unity engine, our goal is to create dynamic, interactive 3D models depicting neuronal networks and simulations, thus making research data more accessible and engaging.
